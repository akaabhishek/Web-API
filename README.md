# Web-API
Use of an API to fetch the latest news and to display it on the web page.
Here in this project i used the concept of API calls to get data from free source and used that data to display on my web page.
Data i displayed on web page is slightly different to from what i recived using API key. To make it look user friendly i tried to show only the heading with bold letters with little discription and added a link button at the end of each news discription so if the user is intrested in reading the full news he/she may click on the link to get to know about the full article which will open up in the new page.
I used bootstrap framework to customize the user interface and used JavaScript in the backend for making API calls.
Thanks and I hope you'll like my little project.
